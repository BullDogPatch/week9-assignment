🎯 Set up user sign-up and user login using Clerk. ✅
🎯 Create and display an error/not found page if the user visits a page that doesn’t exist. ✅
🎯 Use 1 or more Radix UI Primitive component, or something similar (e.g. use of a different component library to enhance UX, not just Tailwind). ✅
🎯 Enable users to create a user profile, and input profile information (such as a user biography) using a form. Users and user information should be stored in their own table in the database and handled with an appropriate route (e.g. /user/[userId]). ✅
🎯 Enable users to create posts associated with their Clerk userId. Posts should be displayed on the user’s profile page. ✅
